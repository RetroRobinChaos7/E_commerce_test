notes: don't know if i will work on this after im doen with the project but 
i might come back to add new things as i learn more about webdev.

note: lost a significant amount of progress because my xamp wasnt worinking.
When i deleted xamp i forgot to take out my src folder from xamp.
Atleast i do commit to git hub so not all was lost but had to redo a bunch of stuff.
Also i have to redo the databses because i thought i copied over everything it wouold need to work,
turns out i didnt and now i have to redo them, no matter thos isnce its a simple fix.
Currently im fixing up the user profile page, after its complete i will however begin implamenting a search bar
