//The goal for this script is to show all of the users listing in accending order.
/*Current issues:
-If there are more than one listing then they display on top of eachother and not next to each other.
-When there are more than 4 listings i need the background block to resize in height to accomodate a new row
-Need to be able to view each listigs own page just by double clicking it.
-WIP
